# Fourier-Transform

The autor of this function is Marc Le√≥n Gimeno, telecommunication engineer, specialized in software development and interested in Artificial Intelligence.

This is an implementation of the Fourier Transform in Python. The function returns the samples of the Fourier Transform between a range of x of 0 and 0.5 and the number of samples between 0 and 1.

To use this function, download and save it in the same folder as your project. Then, call this function into your project using: import Fourier_Transform. If you change the name of this file, remember to change tha name when doing the import.

To use this function in your program write: X, N = FourierTransform(x, Nf)

  X: Vector with transform samples
  N: Number of samples of the Fourier Transform (range between 0 and 1)
  
  x: Vector of audio samples
  Nf: Number of sambples of the Fourier Transform (range between 0 and 0.5)

You are able to make all the changes you want and try to improve this code! Good Luck!
