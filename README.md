# Fourier-Transform

        Input values:
            x: data vector with temporal samples
            Nf: number of samples of the Fourier Transform (x range between 0 and 0.5)
        
        Return values:
            X: data vector with the Fourier Transform samples
            N: number of samples in the range [0, 1)
